    "content" : "What am I in the eyes of most people — a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person — somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low.\n\nAll right, then — even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart.\n\nThat is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love in spite of everything, based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion.\n\nThough I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven towards these things with an irresistible momentum.\n\n#claguefineart #fineart #oilpainting #portrait #portraitsketch #portraitpainting",
